# Developer Profile Generator

## About

This application will serve as a template engine that takes in a user's GitHub username and choice of color, and then populates and renders an HTML file with pertinent professional information about the user, which then is converted to an easier-to-export PDF file. This allows the user to create a profile page which looks good and is easy to read. This can then easily be attached to a resume, for example. Or an employer may want to have a concise index of all of their team members. They would simply have to enter the GitHub username for each team member, and the application would produce a handy profile for each.
